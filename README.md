# Fridge: A Personal Project

## Description

This is a fridge application, meant to simulate a fridge and the daily simple tasks that you can do with a fridge, *plus some extra features I added as enhancement*.

I have chosen this project because I recently decided to start cooking consistently this school year. The tasks that can be done in this application is meant to mirror the things I do every day, or wish I could do with my fridge.

This project was created mainly with my needs in mind, but as it is a fridge, this application can be **useful for the general population**, especially those who cook often and like to know what is in their fridge.


## User Stories:
- As a user, you can **open and close** the fridge.
- As a user, you can **add** food items into the fridge.
- As a user, you can **remove** food items from the fridge.
- As a user, you can **view** all the food items that are inside the fridge.
- As a user, you can **select** a food item and check its description *(name, food group, amount, expiration days left)*
- As a user, you can **input** an ingredients list and check if the fridge **contains** the given food items.
